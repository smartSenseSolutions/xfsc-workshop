## Intro

### Our Cloud Deployment

<p>
    <img src="./img/smart-x-cloud.png" alt="Smart X Cloud Deployment" width="800">
</p>

## Prerequisites

### AWS Account

Make sure you have an active AWS account for the setup.

If you don't have an AWS account, and want to setup only the frontend locally, please follow this [Readme](https://github.com/smartSenseSolutions/xfsc-workshop/blob/main/Exercise-1/frontend_readme.md)

### Domain Name üìå

Acquire a public domain name. This will be crucial for setting up a hosted zone in Route 53.

### Hosted Zone in AWS üåê

Configure a hosted zone in AWS associated with your domain name. This enables the creation of new records and sub-domains.

### Key Pair for SSH üîê

We have prepared this setup for two AWS regions: `US East(N. Virginia) us-east-1` and `Europe (Frankfurt) eu-central-1`. You can choose either one of these regions for your cloud deployment.

[Create a key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html) in your AWS account (in `US East(N. Virginia) us-east-1` or `Europe (Frankfurt) eu-central-1` region, according to your preference) for SSH access to your ec2 instance.

## Clone the Repository, If not done already

```sh
git clone https://github.com/smartSenseSolutions/xfsc-workshop/tree/main
```

## Deploy Smart-X!

## Configurations

üîê

### SSH into the Instance

-   Copy the `Ec2PublicIP` from the Output section.

-   Open your terminal and ssh into the Instance:

    ```sh
    ssh -i {path-to-key.pem} ubuntu@{ec2-public-ip}
    ```

    -   **SSH Troubleshooting**

        -   `UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!`

            -   If you get an error regarding `WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!`
                <p>
                    <img src="./img/unprotected-private-key.png" alt="WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE" width="600">
                </p>
            -   Execute the below command and then try to ssh again

                ```sh
                chmod 400 {path-to-key.pem}
                ```

        -   `Too many authentication failures`

            -   If you get an error regarding `Too many authentication failures`
                <p>
                    <img src="./img/too-many-auth.png" alt="Too many authentication failures" width="600">
                </p>
            -   Add a additional flag `-o IdentitiesOnly=yes` to your ssh command and try again.

                ```sh
                ssh -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -i {path-to-key.pem} ubuntu@{ec2-public-ip}
                ```

Once you are in the Ec2 Instance, proceed with changing environment variables and configurations.

### Change Variables in `k8s/configmap.yaml`

üõ†Ô∏è

-   `SERVER_IP`: Set to "Ec2PublicIp" from the Outputs.

-   `K8S_BASE_PATH`: Set to "Ec2PrivateIP" from the Outputs
    (e.g., "https://{ec2-private-ip}:8443" -> "https://10.0.1.18:8443").

-   `BASE_DOMAIN`: Your Base Domain. Entered during the stack creation. You can also get it from the CloudFormation Output tab from field name "HostedZoneName".

-   `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: Set to "S3BucketName" from the Outputs.

-   `OCM_SERVER_HOST`: Provided. (If you want to use different OCM Engine, you can specify host here).

-   `HOST`: Replace with your domain name provided during the stack creation
    (e.g., "http://gaiax.{your-domain}:30017" -> "http://gaiax.smartsenselabs.com:30017").

Make sure indentation is correct while pasting values, as these are YAML files.

Save and close the file.

### Change Variables in `k8s/secret.yaml`

üîë

`NOTE!`: All the secrets in `secret.yaml` file should be base64 encoded. Also make sure you don't paste any new line characters with the encoded string.

This is an example below to create base64 encoding for `secretMessage`.

```sh
echo -n "secretMessage" | base64
```

<p>
    <img src="./img/base64.png" alt="Base64 Command" width="300">
</p>

Similarly, you have to create base64 encoding for all the secret values as mentioned below before pasting them in `secret.yaml` file.

-   `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`: Set to base 64 encoding of 'MyIAMAccessKey' from the Outputs.

-   `AWS_SECRET_KEY`: Set to base 64 encoding of 'MyIAMSecretKey' from the Outputs.

-   `HOSTED_ZONE_ID`: Set to base 64 encoding of 'HostedZoneID' from the Outputs.

-   `CREDENTIAL_DEFINITION_ID`: Provided.

-   `PARTICIPANT_CREDENTIAL_DEFINITION_ID`: Provided.

-   Leave `K8S_TOKEN` as it is, it will be automatically generated.

Save and close the file.

NOTE: Base64 encoding is required only for `secret.yaml` file. Now, in further configurations you won't need to do that.

### Change Domain Names in `k8s/ingress.yaml`

Replace `[your-domain]` with your actual domain name in the `k8s/ingress.yaml` file.
(Total 6 places)

Don't keep the Square brackets from `[your-domain]`.

(e.g., "gaia-x.`[your-domain]`" will be "gaia-x.`smartsenselabs.com`")

</p>

<p>
    <img src="./img/ingress4.png" alt="Ingress" width="450">
</p>

### Change Email in `k8s/issuer.yaml`

Enter your email address replacing `example@gmail.com`. Email will be used for ACME registration

### Execute `run.sh` üöÄ

-   There is a shell script called `run.sh` in the root folder of your Ec2 Instance.

<p>
<img src="./img/run.png" alt="Stack Create Compltete" width="800">
</p>

-   Execute that shell script with command below.

```sh
./run.sh
```

-   This process will take a few minutes to complete. Ensure that you don't stop the execution. Move ahead only after the execution is finished and you are prompted back to the terminal.

    -   If there are any errors, try to execute `run.sh` again.

        ```sh
        ./run.sh
        ```

Make sure `K8S_TOKEN` is properly set in `k8s/secret.yaml` file.

Lastly, run this command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress.yaml
```

Wait for a few moments to ensure all services are up and running.

Verify your service running using `kc get po` command, the output of this should look like as below:

![image](https://github.com/smartSenseSolutions/xfsc-workshop/assets/45592624/1218b835-6d60-4287-a4c7-dbea08cc00a3)

Some useful commands to debug:

1. View logs of the pod: `kc logs -f <pod name>`
2. View k8s service `kc get svc`
3. View k8s secret `kc get secret`
4. To apply k8s config file `kc apply -f  <file name>`
5. Restart pod: `kc delete po <pod name>`
6. Redeploy the application after code changes `deploy` and select the application number

## Note Regarding AWS Resource Charges

Numerous resources are provisioned in our AWS account via the CloudFormation template. Should you wish to continue utilizing the Smart-X PoC, you have the option to retain these resources within your AWS account. However, please be aware that maintaining these resources will result in charges corresponding to their usage duration.

To avoid incurring any charges, please follow the below section to remove all the resources from your AWS account.

## Delete all the Resources and Stack

-   Remove all the objects from your created S3 bucket.

    -   Go to your S3 bucket, you will get the bucket name, from cloudformation output section.
    -   Make sure there are not objects in your bucket, If there are objects, select all of them and delete.

-   Remove the Cloudformation stack

    -   You can easily remove the stack from the CloudFormation console. This action will effectively delete the associated resources which were provisioned during the stack creation.

    <p>
    <img src="./img/delete-stack.png" alt="Delete Stack" width="900">
    </p>

-   Lastly, clear the records in HostedZone

    -   Go to your HostedZone.
    -   If you tried onboarding an enterprise on Smart-X POC, for example `xyz` company. There will be an `A` record of `xyz.{your-domain}` in your hostedzone. You can delete all such records.

-   HostedZone

    -   Having a HostedZone was a prerequisite for this deployment, so if you don't want to perform this deployment again, you can delete the HostedZone as well.

### Happy hacking! üôå
