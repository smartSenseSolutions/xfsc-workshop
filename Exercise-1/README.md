## Intro

### Our Cloud Deployment

<p>
    <img src="./img/smart-x-cloud.png" alt="Smart X Cloud Deployment" width="800">
</p>

## Prerequisites

### AWS Account

Make sure you have an active AWS account for the setup.

### Domain Name üìå

Acquire a public domain name. This will be crucial for setting up a hosted zone in Route 53.

### Hosted Zone in AWS üåê

Configure a hosted zone in AWS associated with your domain name. This enables the creation of new records and sub-domains.

### Key Pair for SSH üîê

[Create a key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html) in your AWS account (in `US East(N. Virginia) us-east-1` region) for SSH access to your instance.

## Clone the Repository, If not done already

```sh
git clone https://github.com/smartSenseSolutions/xfsc-workshop/tree/main
```

## Deploy Smart-X!

üöÄ

### Deploy the Stack Using the CloudFormation Template

1.  Go to CloudFormation in your AWS Console.

    -   Select Region: `US East(N. Virginia) us-east-1`
    <p>
    <img src="./img/region.png" alt="AWS Region" width="900">
    </p>

2.  Create a new Stack: `With new resources(standard)`
    <p>
    <img src="./img/new-stack.png" alt="AWS New Stack" width="700">
    </p>

    -   Under `Prerequisite`: Keep the default "Template is Ready" selected.

    -   Under `Specify Template`: Select "Upload a Template file"

    -   Upload the [template.json](https://github.com/smartSenseSolutions/xfsc-workshop/blob/6944e9b1928b23a76ba17f31b5d45316c965382e/Exercise-1/template.json) file from this repo.

    <p>
    <img src="./img/upload-temp.png" alt="AWS New Stack" width="700">
    </p>

    -   Click "Next"

3.  Specify stack details:

    -   `Stack Name`: Name you want to provide to the CloudFormation Stack (e.g., smart-x)

    -   `AmiID`: Provide the below AMI ID

    ```sh
    ami-036485415abbfb85e
    ```

    -   `AvailabilityZoneName`: Select your preferred availability zone.

    -   `DomainName`: Enter your domain name configured in the hosted zone (e.g., `smartsenselabs.com`).

    -   `HostedZoneId`: Select your configured hosted zone.

    -   `KeyPair`: Select a key pair for accessing your EC2 instance.

    -   `VpcName`: You can leave it as is or enter your preferred name.

    -   Click "Next"

4.  Configure stack options:

    -   Under `Stack failure options` select "Delete all newly created resources" for rollback.

    -   Click "Next"

5.  Review your stack:

    -   Acknowledge the warning by tickmark

    -   Click "Submit"

The CloudFormation stack is being provisioned. Wait until all resources are deployed (this may take a few minutes).

Refresh the Events Tab to see the status.

<p>

</p>

Once complete, view all deployed resources in the Resources tab.

<p>
<img src="./img/cf-resources.png" alt="Cloudfront Resources Tab" width="800">
</p>

There are some details in the Output Tab after you cloudfront stack creation is done. Keep the Output tab open for further reference.

## Configurations

üîê

### SSH into the Instance

-   Copy the `Ec2PublicIP` from the Output section.

-   Open your terminal and ssh into the Instance:

    ```sh
    ssh -i {path-to-key.pem} ubuntu@{ec2-public-ip}
    ```

    -   If you get an error regarding `WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!`
        <p>
            <img src="./img/unprotected-private-key.png" alt="WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE" width="600">
        </p>
    -   Execute the below command and then try to ssh again

        ```sh
        chmod 400 {path-to-key.pem}
        ```

Once you are in the Ec2 Instance, proceed with changing environment variables and configurations.

### Change Variables in `k8s/configmap.yaml`

üõ†Ô∏è

-   `SERVER_IP`: Set to "Ec2PublicIp" from the Outputs.

-   `K8S_BASE_PATH`: Set to "Ec2PrivateIP" from the Outputs
    (e.g., "https://{ec2-private-ip}:8443" -> "https://10.0.1.18:8443").

-   `BASE_DOMAIN`: Your Base Domain (TODO: clarify its usage).

-   `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: Set to "S3BucketName" from the Outputs.

-   `OCM_SERVER_HOST`: Provided. (If you want to use different OCM Engine, you can specify host here).

-   `HOST`: Replace with your domain name provided during the stack creation
    (e.g., "http://gaiax.{your-domain}:30017" -> "http://gaiax.smartsenselabs.com:30017").

Make sure indentation is correct while pasting values, as these are YAML files.

Save and close the file.

### Change Variables in `k8s/secret.yaml`

üîë

`NOTE!`: All the secrets in `secret.yaml` file should be base64 encoded. Also make sure you don't paste any new line characters with the encoded string.

This is an example below to create base64 encoding for `secretMessage`.

```sh
echo -n "secretMessage" | base64
```

<p>
    <img src="./img/base64.png" alt="Base64 Command" width="300">
</p>

Similarly, you have to create base64 encoding for all the secret values as mentioned below before pasting them in `secret.yaml` file.

-   `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`: Set to base 64 encoding of 'MyIAMAccessKey' from the Outputs.

-   `AWS_SECRET_KEY`: Set to base 64 encoding of 'MyIAMSecretKey' from the Outputs.

-   `HOSTED_ZONE_ID`: Set to base 64 encoding of 'HostedZoneID' from the Outputs.

-   `CREDENTIAL_DEFINITION_ID`: Provided.

-   `PARTICIPANT_CREDENTIAL_DEFINITION_ID`: Provided.

-   Leave `K8S_TOKEN` as it is, it will be automatically generated.

Save and close the file.

NOTE: Base64 encoding is required only for `secret.yaml` file. Now, in further configurations you won't need to do that.

### Change Domain Names in `k8s/ingress.yaml`

Replace `[your-domain]` with your actual domain name in the `k8s/ingress.yaml` file.
(Total 6 places)

Don't keep the Square brackets from `[your-domain]`.

(e.g., "gaia-x.`[your-domain]`" will be "gaia-x.`smartsenselabs.com`")

<p>
    <img src="./img/ingress2.png" alt="Ingress" width="450">

    <img src="./img/ingress3.png" alt="Ingress" width="450">
</p>

<p>
    <img src="./img/ingress4.png" alt="Ingress" width="450">
</p>

### Change Email in `k8s/issuer.yaml`

Enter your email address replacing `example@gmail.com`. Email will be used for ACME registration

### Execute `run.sh` üöÄ

-   There is a shell script called `run.sh` in the root folder of your Ec2 Instance.

<p>
<img src="./img/run.png" alt="Stack Create Compltete" width="800">
</p>

-   Execute that shell script with command below.

```sh
./run.sh
```

-   This process will take a few minutes to complete. Ensure that you don't stop the execution. Move ahead only after the execution is finished and you are prompted back to the terminal.

    -   If there are any errors, try to execute `run.sh` again.

        ```sh
        ./run.sh
        ```

Make sure `K8S_TOKEN` is properly set in `k8s/secret.yaml` file.

Lastly, run this command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress.yaml
```

Wait for a few moments to ensure all services are up and running.

Verify your service running using `kc get po` command, the output of this should look like as below:

![image](https://github.com/smartSenseSolutions/xfsc-workshop/assets/45592624/1218b835-6d60-4287-a4c7-dbea08cc00a3)

Some useful commands to debug:

1. View logs of the pod: `kc logs -f <pod name>`
2. View k8s service `kc get svc`
3. View k8s secret `kc get secret`
4. To apply k8s config file `kc apply -f  <file name>`
5. Restart pod: `kc delete po <pod name>`
6. Redeploy the application after code changes `deploy` and select the application number
